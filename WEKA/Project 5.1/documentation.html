				The location recorded is the patient's place of residence at the time of diagnosis,
				regardless of the patient's current residence.				
				</li><li> 
				Regions do not include the metropolitan statistical areas (MSAs)
				listed separately in the dataset. 
				</li><li> 
				Regions include adult and adolescent patients 
				residing in a metropolitan area with less than 500,000 
   				population, in a non-metropolitan area, 
				or whose metropolitan area of residence is unknown, 
				and all pediatric patients 
				(person less than 13 years of age at the time of diagnosis).
				See the Regions table below.
   				</li><li> 
				Metropolitan areas do not include pediatric cases,
				pediatric cases are reported in regional areas for privacy reasons. 
				Pediatric cases are where the age at diagnosis is less than 13 years of age,
				regardless of the patient's current age.
				</li><li>
				Three cities are not available in the vintage 1999 dataset,

				<li>
				Maps can be made when the data are grouped by Location.
				However, only the metropolitan areas are displayed on the maps.
				Although regions are not displayed on the maps,  
				regional data are included in the quantile distributions 
				when regions are included in the data results.
				</li>
			-->
				<li>
				When the data results are exported to a file,
				the location codes are included in a separate column. 
				See the Location Codes table below.
				Each Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA) is identified by a 4-digit code. 
				</li><li>
				The WONDER online databases's Location variable is based on the

				<i>About Exposure Category:&nbsp;&nbsp;</i> 
				Some patients may have more than 
				one mode of exposure to HIV. For surveillance purposes, AIDS cases are 
    				counted only once in a hierarchy of exposure categories. Persons with more 
    				than one reported mode of exposure are listed in the category that appears 
    				first in the exposure hierarchy, except for men with both a history of 
    				sexual contact with other men and injecting drug use. 
				These patients make up a separate exposure category. 
				Persons with multiple reported modes of exposure are indicated in Multiple Modes of Exposure.
				</li><li>
				"Men who have sex with men" cases include men who report sexual contact with other men 
				(i.e., homosexual contact) and men who report sexual contact with both men and women (i.e., bisexual contact). 
				</li><li>
				"Heterosexual contact" cases are persons who report specific heterosexual contact 
				with a person with, or at increased risk for, HIV infection 
				(e.g., an injecting drug user). 
				</li><li>
				"Risk not reported or identified" cases are persons with no reported history of 
				exposure to HIV through any of the routes listed in the hierarchy of exposure categories. 
				Risk not reported or identified cases include persons who are currently under investigation by local health department officials; 
				persons whose exposure history is incomplete because they died, 
				declined to be interviewed, or were lost to follow-up; and persons who were interviewed or for whom other follow-up information was available and no exposure mode was identified. 
				Persons who have an exposure mode identified at the time of follow-up are reclassified into the appropriate exposure category. 
				</li><li>
				Adult/adolescent patients and pediatric patients have separate exposure categories.
				<BR><b>Adult/adolescent exposure categories:</b>
				<DD> 1 - Men who have sex with men
				<DD> 2 - Injecting drug use <br>
				<DD> 3 - Men who have sex with men and inject drugs<br>
				<DD> 4 - Hemophilia/coagulation disorder<br>
				<DD> 5 - Heterosexual contact with a person with, or at increases risk for, HIV infection<br>
				<DD> 7 - Receipt of blood transfusion, blood components, or tissue<br>
				<DD> 8 - Risk not reported or identified
				<BR><b>Pediatric exposure categories:</b>
				<DD> &nbsp;9 - Pediatric hemophilia/coagulation disorder<br>
				<DD> 10 - Mother with, or at risk for, HIV infection<br>
				<DD> 11 - Pediatric receipt of blood transfusion, blood components, or tissue<br>
				<DD> 12 - Pediatric risk not reported or identified
				</li><li>
				The HIV Exposure Category variable in the WONDER online database is from the 
				Exposure variable in columns 18-19 in the APIDS dataset. 
				This variable indicates the patient's mode of exposure to HIV.

				<i>About Pattern II countries:&nbsp;&nbsp;</i>
					<ul><li>
				"Pattern II" is a term adopted by the World Health Organization, and refers
				to countries with a distinctive pattern of HIV transmission. It is observed
				in areas of central, eastern, and southern Africa and in some Caribbean
				countries. In these countries, most of the reported cases occur in
				heterosexuals; the male to female ratio is approximately 1 to 1; and
				perinatal transmission is more common than in other areas. Intravenous drug
				use and homosexual transmission either do not occur or occur at low levels.
					</li><li>
				Adults/adolescents born, or who had sex with someone born, 
				in a country where heterosexual transmission was believed to be the predominant mode of HIV transmission 
				(formerly classified as "Pattern-II countries" by the World Health Organization) 
				are no longer classified as having heterosexually acquired AIDS. 
				Similar to case reports for other persons who are reported without behavioral or transfusion risks for HIV, these reports are now classified (in the absence of other risk information which would classify them into another exposure category) as 
				"no risk reported or identified" 
				(see Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report, March 11, 1994). 
					</li><li>
				Children whose mother was born, or whose mother had sex with someone born, 
				in a Pattern-II country are now classified (in the absence of other risk information which would classify them into another exposure category) 
				as "Mother with/at risk for HIV infection: has HIV infection, risk not specified."

				<i>Historical background of case definition revisions:&nbsp;&nbsp;</i>
				<BR>
				Before HIV was identified as the etiologic agent for AIDS, 
				CDC defined a case of AIDS (for surveillance purposes) as a disease, 
				at least moderately indicative of a defect in cell-mediated immunity, 
				occurring in a person with no known cause for diminished resistance to the disease. 
				Such diseases included Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia, Kaposi's sarcoma, 
				and many other serious opportunistic infections 
				(see American Journal of Medicine, March 1984, pages 493-500). 
				With identification of HIV as the causative agent for AIDS 
				and the availability of laboratory tests to detect HIV antibody, 
				the case definition was expanded to reflect 
				an increased understanding of HIV infection in 1985 
				(see CDC's <a href="AIDS/MMWR-06-28-1985.html">Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report, June 28, 1985, pages 373-375<a/>) 
				and in 1987 (see <a href="AIDS/MMWR-08-14-1987.pdf">Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report, August 14, 1987, 
				supplement, pages 3S-15S</a>). 
				These revisions applied to persons with laboratory evidence for HIV infection. 
				Among diseases added in 1985 were disseminated histoplasmosis, 
				chronic isosporiasis, and certain non-Hodgkin's lymphomas. 
				Among those added in 1987 were extrapulmonary tuberculosis, 
				HIV encephalopathy, and HIV wasting syndrome. 
				In children, recurrent, serious bacterial infections were also added.
				In addition, the 1987 revision allowed certain indicator diseases 
				to be diagnosed presumptively based on clinical presentation 
				rather than "confirmed" by laboratory or diagnostic methods.
				<p>
				To be consistent with standards of medical care for HIV-infected persons 
				and to more accurately reflect the number of persons with 
				severe HIV-related immunosuppression who are at highest risk 
				for HIV-related morbidity and most in need of close medical follow-up, 
				the surveillance definition was expanded on January 1, 1993 
				(see CDC's <a href="AIDS/MMWR-12-18-1992.html">Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report, 
				Recommendations and Reports, December 18, 1992</a>). 
				This expansion includes all 
				HIV-infected adults and adolescents who have less that 200 CD4+ T-lymphocytes/L 
				or a CD4+ T-lymphocyte percent of total lymphocytes less than 14, 
				or who have been diagnosed with pulmonary tuberculosis, 
				invasive cervical cancer, or recurrent pneumonia.
				The addition of pulmonary tuberculosis, recurrent pneumonia,
				and invasive cervical cancer in HIV-infected adults and 
				adolescents to the 23 clinical conditions 
				listed in the 1987 surveillance definition 
				reflects their documented or potential importance in the HIV epidemic.
				<p>
				While the reported incidence of AIDS increased 
				only 3 to 4 percent as a result of the 1985 revision, 
				the 1987 revision greatly increased the numbers of reported cases. 
				Roughly one fourth of all adults/adolescents 
				who were both diagnosed and reported in 
				the year following the 1987 revision were reported based only 
				on the additional criteria included in the 1987 revision. 
				Furthermore, the proportion of cases meeting only 
				the revised criteria was higher in Hispanics and 
				non-Hispanic blacks than in non-Hispanic whites, 
				higher in heterosexual injecting drug users, 
				and lower in men who have sex with men. 
				The 1993 revision has had 
				substantial impact on the number of reported cases. 
				The immediate increase in case reporting was 
				largely attributed to the addition of severe immunosuppression 
				to the definition; a smaller impact was due to the 
				addition of pulmonary tuberculosis, recurrent pneumonia, 
				and invasive cervical cancer, since many persons with 
				these diseases also have a CD4+ T-lymphocyte 
				count of less than 200 cells/L. 
				The early effects of expanded surveillance were greater 
				than long-term effects because prevalent as well as incident 
				cases of immunosuppression were reported after implementation 
				of the expanded surveillance case definition. In recent years, 
				the effect on the number of reported cases has been smaller. 
				Due to the large number of cases reported based on criteria 
				in only the revised case definitions and to the inconsistent 
				use of the revised case definitions in different populations, 
				analyses of trends in AIDS cases must take these revisions into account.

					</li><li>
				Patients survive for a variable amount of time following the diagnosis of AIDS. 
				Because death usually occurs after the initial report to CDC, 
				case reports may not be updated to reflect the change in vital status. 
				As a result, reporting of deaths among AIDS patients may be delayed or incomplete. 
				However, states are required to perform periodic reviews of death certificates 
				and state death registries to identify unreported cases, and to update vital status of known cases. 
				In addition, 16 states participated in a special project to match their case registries 
				to the National Death Index to assess the completeness of reporting and 
				to identify deaths among cases that died out-of-jurisdiction.

								contain additional exposure information for patients infected heterosexually. 
								<br><br>
								The 'Heterosexual Partner is Bisexual Male' variable is coded only for women.

								This restriction is necessary in order to comply with the Assurance of Confidentiality. 
								Of the 4,596 AIDS cases reported through December 1995 among adults/adolescents with hemophilia, 
								less than 4 percent also reported heterosexual contact with a person at increased risk for AIDS or HIV infection.

							</li><li>
								<B>About the classification of 'Vital Status:'&nbsp;&nbsp;</B>
								<p>
								Patients diagnosed during the 2 most recent years are coded as Alive

								for the most recent two-year period should be interpreted with caution. 
								The rates calculated will be artificially high because all persons

								</p>
							</li><li>
								<B>About unidentified risk:&nbsp;&nbsp;</B>
								<p>
  								Adults/adolescents born, or who had sex with someone born, in a country where heterosexual transmission 
								was believed to be the predominant mode of HIV transmission (formerly classified as Pattern-II countries 
								by the World Health Organization) are no longer classified as having heterosexually acquired AIDS. 
								Similar to case reports for other persons who are reported without behavioral or transfusion risks for HIV, 
								these reports are now classified (in the absence of other risk information which would 
								classify them into another exposure category) as 'no risk reported or identified' 
								(see CDC's Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report, March 11, 1994). Children whose mother was born, 
								or whose mother had sex with someone born, in a Pattern-II country are now classified 
								(in the absence of other risk information which would classify them into another exposure category) 
								as 'Mother with/at risk for HIV infection: has HIV infection, risk not specified.'
								</p>
							</li><li>
								<B>About exposure and pediatric patients (age under 13 years at diagnosis):&nbsp;&nbsp;</B>
								<p>
								Pediatric cases are classified in just 4 exposure categories:
								<br> 1) Hemophilia/coagulation disorder
								<br> 2) Mother with, or at risk for, HIV infection
								<br> 3) Receipt of blood transfusion, blood components, or tissue
								<br> 4) Risk not reported or identified.
								</p>
							</li><li>
								<B>About the 'Case Definition' category:&nbsp;&nbsp;</B>
								<p>
								Only cases meeting the current (1993) surveillance definition are included in this dataset. The Case Definition Category indicates whether the patient also met the pre-1985, 1985, or 1987 surveillance definition, and whether the diagnosis, if it meets the 1987 or 1993 definition, was definitive or presumptive. Cases that meet more than one of these surveillance definitions are classified into the category listed  first. For more information about the 1993 definition, 
								see Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report, December 18, 1992, Recommendations and Reports.
								For more information about the pediatric case definition, 
								see Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report, September 30, 1994, Recommendations and Reports.
								
								</p>
							</li><li>
								<B>About the 1993 surveillance definition for AIDS:&nbsp;&nbsp;</b> 
								<p>
								     1) the definitive diagnosis refers to pulmonary tuberculosis, recurrent pneumonia, and/or cervical cancer; 
								<BR> 2) the presumptive diagnosis refers to pulmonary tuberculosis and/or recurrent pneumonia; 
								<BR> 3) the immunologic diagnosis refers to severe HIV-related immunosuppression.
								</p>
							</li><li>
								<B>About 'Multiple Modes of Exposure:'&nbsp;&nbsp;</B>
								<p>
								'Multiple Modes of Exposure' data are reported only for adult/adolescent patients (13 years old or older) and indicates if the patient has risk(s) of exposure to HIV other than the one indicated by exposure.
								</p>
							</li><li>
								<B>About age groups:&nbsp;&nbsp;</B>
								<p>
								Age groups classify the patient's age at time of diagnosis.  The age groups are structured in irregular ranges, in order to affect numerator size and protect confidentiality. For example, cases where age is 'Missing' are included in the age 35-39 year old range.
								</p>
							</li><li>
								<B>About 'Sex and Sexual Orientation:'&nbsp;&nbsp;</B>
								<p>
								Only Adult/adolescent males are classified according to their sexual orientation. The variable for sexual classification has just 4 categories:
								<br> 1) Adult/adolescent male who has sex only with other men, 
								<DD> or sex is Missing, 
								<DD> or sexual orientation is Missing
								<br> 2) Adult/adolescent male who has sex with Both men and women
								<br> 3) Adult/adolescent heterosexual male or Pediatric male<br/>4) Female (both adult/adolescent and pediatric).
								</p>
							</li><li>
								<B>About 'Race or Ethnicity:'&nbsp;&nbsp;</B>
								<p>
								The 'Race or Ethnicity' classification shows only Hispanic ethnicity or a single race, and does not indicate multi-racial or multi-ethnic heritage.
